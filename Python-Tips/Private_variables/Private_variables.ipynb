    "# Private Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Python's official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html), \"Private\" instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don't exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. `_spam`) should be treated as **a non-public part of the API** (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to **avoid name clashes of names** with names defined by `subclasses`), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called *name mangling*.\n",
    "- Any identifier of the form `__spam` (at lease two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with `_classname__spam`, where `classname` is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs within the definiton of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name mangling** is helpful for letting subclasses override methods without breaking intraclass method calls. For example:"
